# pintool-callgraph
* This was an assignment to perform Dynamic Binary Instrumentation
* I had to create a [Pin tool](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool)
* A framework called Pin++ written on top of [Intel Pin](https://software.intel.com/en-us/articles/pin-a-dynamic-binary-instrumentation-tool) was used to facilitate writing a pin tool.
* After creating the pin tool, a [callgraph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Call_graph) had to be generated indicating the control flow between methods in the program.
*Note that the generated callgraph is extremely huge and in order to fit it into one screen, the image size is reduced in the output image.*
*So, in irder to view it, please zoom into the image.*
